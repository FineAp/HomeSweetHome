Today, I'd like to introduce the innovative VR game, 'Home Sweet Home.' In this game, the protagonist, 
who has Alzheimer's disease, searches for evidence in a room and escapes, all while recovering memories. 
It provides players with both emotional and challenging experiences.

Solving puzzles within the room and finding evidence contribute to the gradual recovery of the protagonist's memories, leading players on an emotionally engaging journey.


Various Puzzles and Challenges

The room contains a variety of puzzles. 
By using logical thinking and deduction, players solve these puzzles, aiding in the recovery of the protagonist's memories and unraveling intriguing stories about their past and future.
